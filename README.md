# java-ecosystem-simulator
Console-based ecosystem simulation game built in Java that models emergent life dynamics from simple rules. The project extends the core idea of Conway’s Game of Life into a resource-driven, agent-based world with energy systems, predation, reproduction, and population collapse cycles.
